If you have never used Git before please follow these steps to download 
my files.

(1) Make sure you're on https://gitlab.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/40148258

(2) Click Personal Projects (Halfway down, 4th one in the row of 5 options from the left)

(3) Click Repository at the top (https://gitlab.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/40148258/Jonathan_Duncan_Projects/tree/master)

(4) There is 2 OPTIONS you can do here. 
    (a) You can download my entire repository of projects by clicking the 	
	small download symbol on the right hand side halfway down. 	
	My advice is to download as a .Zip and Unzip at your desired location.

    (b) Download a project of your choice. 
	You can do this by clicking the file you want to download. 
	Then you can either click the download button at the bottom of the 	screen or if that isn't available there should be a small "Raw" button 	at the right hand side which will begin your download.
