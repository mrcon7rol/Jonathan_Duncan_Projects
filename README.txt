If you have never used Git before please follow these steps to download 
my files.

(1) Make sure you're on https://github.com/mrcon7rol/Jonathan_Duncan_Projects

(2) There is 2 OPTIONS you can do here. 
    (a) You can download my entire repository of projects by clicking the 	
	Green 'Clone or download' on the right hand side halfway down. 	
	My advice is to download as a .Zip and Unzip at your desired location.

    (b) Download a project of your choice. 
	You can do this by clicking the file you want to download. 
	Then clicking download on the right hand side.
